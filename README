REQUIREMENTS:
- The game consists of 10 frames.
- In each frame the player can knock down 10 pins at most. The score for the frame is the total
number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

- A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries.  The bonus for
that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.

- A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try.  The bonus
for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

- In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
balls to complete the frame.  However no more than three balls can be rolled in
tenth frame.


CARD 1: As a User I want to know the score of a game computing spare bonuses
SCENARIOS

roll(pins : int) is called each time the player rolls a ball.  The argument is the number of pins knocked down.
score() : int is called only at the very end of the game.  It returns the total score for that game.
